        <h2><b>Summary of Raul's life:</b></h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">
            
Raul Seixas was a Brazilian singer, songwriter, guitarist and producer, one of the most important names in rock music in Brazil. Among his songs are: Maluco Beleza, Eu Nasci Há 10 Mil Anos Ago, Mosca na Sopa and Ouro de Tolo.<br>
Raul Santos Seixas was born in Salvador, Bahia, on June 28, 1945. He was the son of Raul Varela Seixas, a railroad engineer, and Maria Eugênia Santos Seixas.<br>
At the age of seven he started primary school. In 1957 he entered Colégio São Bento, but failed the 2nd grade for three years. He was then sent to the internal course of the Colégio Marista, but he only completed the 3rd grade.<br>
Raul liked to read the books in his father's library and creates his own stories by drawing the characters in the school notebooks. He liked music, but his dream was to be a writer.<br>
As a teenager, he spent hours listening to Elvis Presley and Little Richard's music. In 1959, together with his friend Waldir Serrão, he founded the fan club “Elvis Rock Club”.<br>
